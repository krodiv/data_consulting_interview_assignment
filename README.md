Which North American energy companies stand to benefit the most from implementing a
carbon emissions reduction strategy? Energy companies across the globe are being pushed -
both by consumer sentiment and government regulation - to reduce their carbon footprint. The
impact of carbon reduction is different for every company, as the associated costs and benefits
will differ. Using information from public data sources (such as the EPA emissions database or the
Petrinex database), evaluate the groups of companies that would benefit the most from
implementing a carbon reduction program.


Part b) Are there any similarities between the companies you identified as benefiting the
most? Are they generally motivated by regulations or consumer preferences? If you were
at a company who helped implement carbon reduction strategies, what would your pitch
be to these energy companies?
