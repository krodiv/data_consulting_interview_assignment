they follow and many even build simple models to guide their trades.
Using any data available to you, propose a strategy to maximize profit for a trader for a

risk be quantified? How can risk be incorporated into the profitability of the strategy?
How can the benefits and drawbacks of the strategy be articulated to a person with no
